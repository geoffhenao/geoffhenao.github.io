v1: I just finished my second game, a one-screen platformer. I've swapped out some of the default assets to include my cat, Sonic SFX, and some other things.

Future state: Add more levels, replace default ground tiles, replace coins with Binterman items, add in title screen, add zoom in/out upon level completion.
